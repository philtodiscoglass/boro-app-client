**Boro App**

This application is for glass artists. It allows you to create and account and share your work. Create posts and view other's posts.

**Here are the links to my deployed application and my reposository:**

* [Server Repo](https://github.com/philtodiscoglass/boro-app)
* [Application](https://philtodiscoglass.github.io/boro-app-client/)

I started with auth, and then moved on to creating my models/schema for my resource (glass posts). I continued with handlebars to handle my resource being rendered to the page. I then completed with styling and hide/show features.
